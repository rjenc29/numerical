# numerical
A repository of numerical routines and research ideas implemented in Python.

Numba JIT-compiled algorithms:
- Exponentially weighted moving average
- Rolling sum

numba.cuda implementations:
- matrix multiplication


Some of these routines offer substantial speed improvements over their pandas / numpy equivalents.
